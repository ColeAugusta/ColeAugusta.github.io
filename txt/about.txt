Hi, I'm Cole Augusta, a senior Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I'm passionate about and pursuing artificial neural networks, computer vision, and general software development. My technical skills include Python, Java, C++, C, Golang, Haskell, JavaScript, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, React, PHP, and various other development tools. Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music, playing chess, and watching anime, which keep me balanced and often inspire creative approaches to my technical work. I'm always open to discussing new projects, career opportunities, or otherwise; so please reach out!
