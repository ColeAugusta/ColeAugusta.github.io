I'm Cole Augusta, a senior Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute passionate about artificial intelligence, computer vision, and software development. I specialize in building intelligent systems that can perceive and understand visual data, from training neural networks for image recognition to developing full-stack applications. My technical skills include Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, React, and various databases and development tools. I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems through clean, efficient code and love exploring new technologies and frameworks. Outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music, playing chess, and watching anime, which keep me balanced and often inspire creative approaches to my technical work. I'm always open to discussing new projects, collaboration opportunities, or just chatting about technology and AI!
