A PyTorch-based binary classification model that predicts whether a song is "hype" or not based on Spotify's audio features. This model was trained on Spotify audio feature data recorded April 2019 and prior. This model makes use of Spotify's audio features (energy, danceability, valence, and tempo) to classify songs into two categories: hype: High-energy, danceable tracks, and not hype: Lower-energy, more relaxed tracks.
