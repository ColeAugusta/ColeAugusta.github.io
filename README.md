I am Cole Augusta, a Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) with a strong foundation in software development and machine learning. My skills include Python, C/C++, HTML/CSS, Java, Golang, Flask/React, MIPS, and Pytorch/Pandas for LLM models. I've developed diverse projects like Track Vision for Formula SAE endurance tracks, Flip for hand movement tracking, Honest Investor for real-time stock updates, and a Web Scraping Keras ML Model. Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music and playing chess. These hobbies provide a balanced mix of relaxation and strategic thinking, helping me stay creative and sharp in both my personal and professional life.
