                <h2>Flip    <img src="img/icons8-python-24.png"></h2>
                <p> Flip is a project designed to provide an easy to use hand movement tracking software for reading ebooks or pdfs on devices with a camera.
                    Other hand detection software can be unreliable and frustrating to use, so Flip plans to create something that users can consistently trust.
                    Flip will allow for users to “swipe” their hands when pointed at a camera connected to their device, and have the device respond accordingly by swiping to the next page. We plan to package our product in a Chrome extension for free, open source, public use. 
                    The project will be created using Python with the OpenCV and NumPy libraries for development of our hand movement tracker,
                    and possibly JavaScript/PyScript for the chrome extension development. Working as a main back-end developer for Flip using Python and MediaPipe models.

                <h2>Pandas Youtube ML Model     <img src="img/icons8-python-24.png"></h2>
                <p>This machine learning model leverages Python's pandas library and YouTube's top trending video data to gather insights about users. By analyzing video statistics,
                    the model can identify trends and patterns that provide valuable information about user preferences and behavior. The training process
                    involves processing extensive data on trending videos to create a robust predictive tool, making it a powerful asset for understanding and targeting YouTube audiences effectively.

                <li><p>Hi!, I'm Cole Augusta, a Computer Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) with a strong foundation in software development and machine learning. My skills include Python, C/C++, HTML/CSS, Java, Golang, Flask/React, MIPS, and Pytorch/Pandas for LLM models. I've developed diverse projects like Track Vision for Formula SAE endurance tracks, Flip for hand movement tracking, Honest Investor for real-time stock updates, and a Web Scraping Keras ML Model.
                    Outside of academics, I enjoy listening to music and playing chess. These hobbies provide a balanced mix of relaxation and strategic thinking, helping me stay creative and sharp in both my personal and professional life.</p></li>
